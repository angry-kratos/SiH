                    The website is brought in front of you by a team named Cyber6. We are a team of six, first year students of
                    IIT Goa. We developed this website seeing it as an opportunity to showcase our
                    skills and also learn new things while developing. This website was created with
                    an intention to help the Central Authority in dealing with the problem of inavailability
                    of a system which can collectively store the placement statistics of all the institutes.
                    While making this website, we divided ourself into three groups, for three different areas
                    of web development i.e Front-End, Back-End, and Database work. For the Front-End we used Reactjs, Django for
                    the Back-End and MySQL for Databasing. We hope that this website will be useful to the Central Authority and
                    the insitiutes would like to store their placement records in this website.
